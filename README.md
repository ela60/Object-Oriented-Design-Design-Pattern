# 🎯 Object-Oriented Design & Design Patterns Lab

This repository contains my implementations for the **Object-Oriented Design and Design Patterns (CSE-4122)** Lab. The goal is to understand and apply various software design patterns using Java and object-oriented principles.

## 🧠 What is Object-Oriented Design (OOD)?

**Object-Oriented Design** is a method of designing software by breaking it down into smaller objects. These objects encapsulate data and behavior and interact with each other to solve complex problems in a structured and modular way.

Key Principles:
- **Encapsulation**
- **Abstraction**
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**

## 🧩 What are Design Patterns?

**Design Patterns** are standard solutions to common problems in software design. They are best practices refined by experienced developers over time and categorized into the following types:

### 🔹 Creational Patterns
- **Singleton**
- **Factory Method**
- **Abstract Factory**
- **Builder**
- **Prototype**

### 🔹 Structural Patterns
- **Adapter**
- **Composite**
- **Decorator**
- **Facade**
- **Proxy**

### 🔹 Behavioral Patterns
- **Strategy**
- **Observer**
- **Chain of Responsibility**
- **Command**
- **Template Method**

## ✅ Implemented Patterns (with UML)

| Pattern                     | Description                                     | UML Diagram         |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Singleton                  | Ensures only one instance is created           | ✅ singleton_uml.png |
| Factory Method             | Interface for creating objects                 | ✅ factory_uml.png   |
| Chain of Responsibility    | Decouples sender and receiver of request       | ✅ chain_uml.png     |
| Strategy                   | Defines a family of algorithms                 | ✅ strategy_uml.png  |
| Observer                   | Notifies multiple objects on state change      | ✅ observer_uml.png  |
| Adapter                   | Converts one interface to another              | ✅ adapter_uml.png   |
